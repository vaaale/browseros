# agent-skill-orchestrator

Intelligent task planning and resource orchestration with confidence scoring and strategic execution plans.

## Overview

`agent-skill-orchestrator` is an AI-powered planning assistant that analyzes your task requirements, discovers available resources (plugins, agents, skills, MCP servers), performs intelligent matching with confidence scoring, and generates comprehensive execution plans with multiple options and fallback strategies.

Think of it as your strategic advisor—it tells you **how** to use **what** you have to accomplish **what** you want.

## Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Analysis** - Understands task type, complexity, and requirements
- **🔍 Fresh Discovery** - Always uses latest resource inventory via agent-skill-discovery
- **📊 Confidence Scoring** - Scores resources 0-100% with transparent reasoning
- **🎯 Strategic Planning** - Generates multiple execution options with alternatives
- **✅ Approval Required** - Never executes without explicit user consent
- **🌐 Platform-Agnostic** - Works on all 8 AI CLI platforms
- **🔄 Fallback Strategies** - Includes alternatives if primary plan fails

## When to Use

Use this skill when you:
- Have a complex task and want the best approach
- Need to coordinate multiple tools or services
- Want optimized resource utilization
- Are unsure which plugins/skills to use
- Need a strategic plan before implementation
- Want to explore multiple solution approaches

## Installation

### Via NPM (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g claude-superskills
claude-superskills install agent-skill-orchestrator agent-skill-discovery
```

**Note:** `agent-skill-discovery` is a required dependency.

### Manual Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-superskills.git
cd claude-superskills
./scripts/build-skills.sh
```

## Usage

Ask your AI CLI to plan your task:

### Claude Code
```bash
claude
> "Plan how to build a REST API with authentication"
> "Help me design a solution for processing meeting notes"
> "What's the best way to create a code review workflow?"
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI
```bash
gh copilot
> "Orchestrate agents to analyze this bug"
> "Create execution plan for feature development"
```

### Gemini CLI / OpenCode / Codex
```bash
gemini  # or: opencode, codex
> "Plan how to solve: implement user authentication"
> "Design approach for data migration"
```

## How It Works

### 1. Discovery (Step 0)
Calls `agent-skill-discovery` to get fresh inventory of all resources

### 2. Analysis (Step 1)
Extracts requirements from your request:
- Task type (development, content, integration, etc.)
- Needed capabilities (code-gen, API calls, web scraping, etc.)
- External integrations (Notion, Jira, GitHub, etc.)

### 3. Intelligent Matching (Step 2)
Scores each resource against requirements using weighted algorithm:
- **30%** Trigger phrase matching
- **25%** Semantic similarity
- **20%** Tool availability
- **15%** Category relevance
- **10%** MCP integration bonus

Resources scoring **80-100%** = High confidence
Resources scoring **60-79%** = Medium confidence
Resources scoring **40-59%** = Low confidence
Resources scoring **< 40%** = Filtered out

### 4. Plan Generation (Step 3)
Creates strategic execution plan with:
- Primary strategy (recommended)
- Alternative strategy (backup approach)
- Prerequisites checklist
- Success criteria
- Risk assessment

### 5. Approval (Step 4)
Presents plan and requests explicit approval before execution

### 6. Execution (Step 5 - Optional)
Executes approved plan with progress reporting

## Example Output

```markdown
## 📊 Discovery Analysis

**Platform:** Claude Code
**Task Type:** development
**Complexity:** moderate
**External Integrations:** None

---

## 🔍 Resources Found (8)

### High Confidence (80-100%)
- **feature-dev:code-architect** [92%] - Designs feature architectures
  - **Why selected:** Best match for API design patterns
- **feature-dev:code-explorer** [88%] - Analyzes existing codebase
  - **Why selected:** Understands existing auth patterns

---

## ✅ Recommended Execution Plan

### Option 1: Primary Strategy (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Use **feature-dev:code-explorer** to analyze patterns
**Step 2:** Use **feature-dev:code-architect** to design API
**Step 3:** Use **skill-creator** to scaffold auth code
**Step 4:** Use **feature-dev:code-reviewer** to validate security

**Expected Outcome:** Secure REST API with JWT authentication
**Estimated Time:** ~45 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low

---

### Option 2: Alternative Strategy
(Faster 2-step approach for rapid prototyping)

---

## ⚠️ Prerequisites
- [ ] Plugin "feature-dev" must be installed
- [ ] Skill "skill-creator" must be installed

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] API endpoints functional
- [ ] JWT auth implemented
- [ ] Security review passes

---

**⏸️ Awaiting your approval to proceed...**
```

## Scoring Algorithm

Resources are scored using five weighted factors:

### 1. Trigger Phrase Matching (30%)
Matches user keywords against resource trigger phrases

### 2. Semantic Similarity (25%)
Compares description text with user request

### 3. Tool Availability (20%)
Checks if resource has tools needed for task

### 4. Category Relevance (15%)
Matches task category with resource category

### 5. MCP Integration Bonus (10%)
Bonus for MCPs when external integration needed

**Final Score:** Sum of weighted factors (0-100 scale)

## Approval System

The orchestrator **NEVER executes without approval**. After presenting the plan, it asks:

```
Which execution plan would you like to proceed with?

[ ] Execute Option 1 (Recommended)
[ ] Execute Option 2 (Alternative)
[ ] Refine plan
[ ] Cancel
```

Choose your preferred option to proceed or cancel safely.

## Troubleshooting

### "No resources found"

**Cause:** No plugins/skills installed, or discovery failed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install resources
claude-superskills install --all

# Verify installation
claude
> "What do I have installed?"
```

### "All scores below 40%"

**Cause:** No good match between request and available resources

**Solution:**
- Rephrase request with more specific keywords
- Install relevant plugins/skills for your task
- Try breaking task into smaller parts

### "agent-skill-discovery not found"

**Cause:** Missing required dependency

**Solution:**
```bash
claude-superskills install agent-skill-discovery
```

### "Plan looks wrong"

**Solution:**
- Select "Refine plan" option
- Provide more context in request
- Try Option 2 (alternative strategy)

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
